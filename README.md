# hello-world
This should be the first repository that I have created.  Although I have had this account for some time.  Well it's about to get active and I am hitting the ground running.  I am working toward landing a career in development, which is what I set my eye on at one point.

Well, here I am following the 'Hello World: What is Github' intrduction/tutorial.  

I am born an raised in the Bay Area.  And I am warm, intuitive, and love to be in and around nature.  In the last several months, I participated in my first adult workshop.  Introduced to the hero within, I am honoring who I am and what I have to offer.  The experience was shifting for me as an individual and who I am in this world.  And this is what I am nurturing and and putting forth.  

I am a caring, and loyal person.  The passion that I have, draws in connections.  With these branches, I hope to spread love and grounding respect to give back to humanity.
